The Brick Breaker game is a classic arcade game recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen using a ball while controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen.

How the game works:
Gameplay Mechanics:

A ball moves around the screen, bouncing off walls, the paddle, and the bricks.
The player uses the keyboard to control the paddle and keep the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.
When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears, and the player earns points.
Win/Loss Conditions:

The player wins the game by breaking all the bricks.
The player loses if the ball falls past the paddle and touches the bottom of the screen.

HTML: Defines the game's structure, including the canvas where the game is rendered.
CSS: Styles the game elements, such as the background, paddle, and bricks, giving the game a polished appearance.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including ball movement, collision detection, score tracking, and level progression.
